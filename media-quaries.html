    <h1>Combination-No1</h1>
    <p>
      The combination below is the combination of max-width 1600px and
      orientation landscape which means if the max-width is above 1600px the
      style that we had applied will not show effect even if the orientation is
      landscape which is the same with the orientation if the orientation is
      changed to portrait then even if the max-width is under the 1600px the
      style that we had applied will still not be shown.

      (Change the orientation from landscape to portrait by inspecting to see
      the effects and also by changing it to portrait the style that we had
      applied their effect on Combination-No2 will be shown but the style that
      we had applied on Combination-No1 wil not be shown because of portrait and
      also it might not show the effect of the styles of some of the ones above
      like for example the (landscape) which is above. )
    </p>
    <p>
      The combination below is the cobination of min-width 500px and orientation
      portrait which means if min-width is below 500px the style that we had
      applied will not be shown even if the orientation is portrait which is the
      same with the orientation if the orientation is changed to portrait then
      even if the min-width is under 500px the style that we had applied will
      still not be shown.

    <h1>The-choice</h1>
    <p>
      If the max-width goes above 800px and in portrait then the effect will not
      apply but if is is below 800 in portrait then the effect will apply and
      also if the orientation is landscape but it goes above 900px the effect of
      the style will not go away because we had put landscape and the option was
      between landscape or 800px so if it is in landscape but it goes above
      900px even if it goes to 3000px in landscape or even more the effect of
      the style will still be shown.

    <h1>Not-all</h1>
    <p>
      If the screen orientation is in landscape then the effect of the style
      will not work because we had written that for example: @media not all and
      (orientation: landscape) the (not all) with the orientation of landscape
      means that if the orientation is in landscape the effect of the style that
      we had written will not be applied because we writted (not all). If we had
      writted only (all) then the effect would be applied on both orientation
      landscape and portrait but we writted (not all) so just because we writted
      that the effect would only be applied on portrait and currently the
      orientation is in landscape but if you want to see the effect of the style
      that i had writted then inspect and change the orientation from landscape
      to portrait then the effect will be applied of the style we had written.
